title: witch's introduction notes
---
Welcome!
If you are reading this, then you must have known me in some capacity.
I wrote this as a way to document what I am going to learn in 2024, as one with zero hands-on creative skills, and the internet as my only teacher.

It is themed as a magic book, because I read this manga called Witch Hat Atelier some time ago and was very inspired. Plus, "magic" sounds much more creative than simply "music" or "art". I view them as magical practice. And instead of "amateur", "apprentice witch" sounds way more fun.

The notes I post here will be all my thoughts regarding the learning of new artistic and creative skills, be it preparation, pathways, assistance, resources I know of, motivation I gathered, troubles I can imagine. I hope that you will find my notes useful in helping you on your own path.

You can head right over to [[preparation]] to start reading, or you can head over to [[archives]] to go to specific notes first.

Thanks for visiting!
