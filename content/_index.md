Welcome!
If you are reading this, then you must have known me in some capacity.
I wrote this as a way to document what I am going to learn in 2024, as a very confused person with zero hands-on skills.

It is themed as a magic book, because I read this manga called Witch Hat Atelier some time ago and was very inspired. Plus, "magic" sounds much more creative than simply "music" or "art". It is just how I view them - magical. And instead of "amateur", "apprentice witch" sounds way more fun.

The notes I post here will be all my thoughts regarding the learning of new skills - preparation, pathways, assistance, troubles. I hope that you will find my notes useful in helping you go further on your path.

Thanks for visiting!
