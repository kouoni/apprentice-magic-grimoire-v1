The world operates on a first impression basis. 
This means that visible results of your learning matters more than anything else. It also means that learning everything theory before you move your hands is simply ineffective, and more importantly a sign of mental unpreparedness.
With the world's information at our fingertips, learning new things as you need them is very much possible. However, it can leave us feeling constantly overwhelmed, because the learning is unstructured and the skill-need gap is always there in front of you. Here are some ways I have thought of, in order to do this kind of learning decently:

1. Ask a concrete question.
Pinpointing exactly what you are looking to do, however minuscule, gives us a goal to focus on researching. e.g How to make transitions between songs better, How to choose a brush, How to do this operation on an array, How to toggle this setting in my Daw etc.
It also makes it way easier to Google (or ask ChatGPT).
2. Focus 
It is easy to jump around and get distracted when there are many moving parts in a project that you cannot control (yet). Dedicate some hours to researching one topic would help us embed a solid new tool in our skillsets.
3. High-level outline
While independent learning lacks structure, our understanding of a subject will nonetheless morph into one. Keep structures (course outlines, summaries) at hand, and expand to your liking.
