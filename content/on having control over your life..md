I suggest living life like its an MMO. Of course it's much more open than one, but the principles to stay in control are the same.
1. Stats and skills
	If is a learnable thing, it can be done in a checklist. 
2. Bulletin Board
- News and info are always ready, and check them every day for opportunities.
3. Friends and connections
- Personally, I hate the word 'networking'. It feels empty.
- People, unless they like you dearly, won't do things for free. Always compensate people fairly, and always look for win-win deals.
4. Flexibility
- Think. Use your head.
