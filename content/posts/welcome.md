I wrote this website as a personal document, mainly to keep myself in check in 2024. It will contain mostly things I learn, and some QoL life mainly.  
So why the name Apprentice Witch Grimoire? I read this manga called Witch Hat Atelier some months ago and it really inspired me. Plus, a magic grimoire sounds way more fun than 'life survival tips'.  
The core concept is simple: I want to create magic. The rest is learning how to.
